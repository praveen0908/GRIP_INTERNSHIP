# Decision Tree Classifier with Iris Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for my GRIP Internship project at the Sparks Foundation, where I implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset. Decision Trees are a widely used machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, and the Iris dataset is a classic dataset for practice and learning.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create and train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal attributes. The project includes the following key components:

- Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the Iris dataset for training and testing.
- Decision Tree Classifier: Building and training a Decision Tree Classifier using the scikit-learn library.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.
- Visualization: Visualizing the Decision Tree for better understanding.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or replicate the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
