# Decision Tree Classifier with Iris Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for my GRIP Internship project at the Sparks Foundation, where I implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset. Decision Trees are a widely used machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, and the Iris dataset is a classic dataset for practice and learning.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to create and train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal attributes. The project includes the following key components:

- Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the Iris dataset for training and testing.
- Decision Tree Classifier: Building and training a Decision Tree Classifier using the scikit-learn library.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.
- Visualization: Visualizing the Decision Tree for better understanding.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or replicate the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveen0908/GRID_INTERNSHIP.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd GRID_INTERNSHIP
3. Install the required Python dependencies:

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Decision_tree_classifier.ipynb

5. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and run the Decision Tree Classifier.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Dataset
   The Iris dataset used in this project is a classic dataset available in scikit-learn. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved the following results on the Iris dataset:

Accuracy: 96.67%
Precision: 96.63%
Recall: 96.67%
F1 Score: 96.65%
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Decision Tree Classifier in accurately classifying iris flowers.
